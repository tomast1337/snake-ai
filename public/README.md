# Exploring MinMax AI-Powered Snake Game in TypeScript

In this article, I'll walk through the implementation of a classic Snake game with an AI player using TypeScript. We'll explore how to structure the game logic, implement the MinMax algorithm, and create an interface that allows both human and AI players to interact with the game.

## Project Architecture

The project is built using TypeScript and follows a modular design with clear interfaces. Here's the core structure:

### Game State Interface

The foundation of our implementation is the `GameState` interface, which defines the contract for our game state:

```typescript
export interface GameState {
  // Direction of the snake
  dx: number;
  dy: number;
  // Grid size
  width: number;
  height: number;
  // Snake position
  snake: Position[];
  // Food position
  food: Position;
  // Game state methods, these are mostly used by the AI agent
  getValidNextPositions: () => Position[];
  getNextGameState: (nextMove: Position) => GameState;
  getScore: () => number;
  isGameOver: () => boolean;
}
```

This interface is crucial as it provides all the necessary information for both the game rendering and AI decision-making.

Anothers interfaces are `Position` and `GameDrawer`, thoise just define the structure of a postion in a cartesian plane and the methods that a game drawer should implement, just to so the logic of the game is separated from the rendering logic.

```typescript
export interface GameDrawer {
  drawGame(state: SnakeGame): void;
  clear(): void;
}

export interface Agent {
  getNextMove: (gameState: GameState) => Position;
}
```

### Core Game Implementation

The `SnakeGame` class implements the game logic with key features:

- Canvas-based rendering
- Keyboard controls (Arrow keys and WASD)
- Collision detection
- Score tracking
- Support for both human and AI players

### AI Agent Implementation

The AI player uses the MinMax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The agent evaluates game states by considering:

- Distance to food
- Wall proximity
- Self-collision risk
- Current score
- Generate future game states to simulate possible moves

All agents implement the `Agent` interface, which defines the `getNextMove` method:

```typescript
interface Agent {
  getNextMove: (gameState: GameState) => Position;
}
```

## Key Technical Challenges

### 1. Game State Management

Managing game state was one of the primary challenges. The solution involves:

- Immutable state updates
- Clear separation between rendering and game logic
- Efficient state copying for AI simulation

### 2. AI Decision Making

The MinMax with alpha-beta pruning algorithm was implemented to make the AI player competitive. Key challenges include:

- Path finding in diagonal situations
- Performance optimization with alpha-beta pruning
- Evaluation function tuning

### 3. Performance Optimization

Several optimizations were implemented:

- Efficient canvas rendering
- Memory management for long-running games
- State evaluation caching
